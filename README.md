# Oracle APEX and Digital Assistant

![Oracle](images/logo_top.png)

## Conversational approach to your applications

This workshop walks you through the steps to use Autonomous Database and Application Express (APEX) to store information, offer a REST API with Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS) and enable you to interact with your customers by keeping a conversation with Digital Assistant.

## Who Should Do This Workshop

You want to **store information in a easy and powerful database** and provide **a 24/7 conversational experience** with people using your services.

You want to **learn Oracle Digital Assistant**.

You are also interested in exploring modern and quick **APEX** development and build **secure and powerful REST APIs**.

## Requirements

In order to walk through this workshop you need an **active Oracle Cloud Account**. If you don't have one:

[>> Please Sign-Up a Free Tier Oracle Cloud account <<](http://bit.ly/34TzwGf)

> It takes few minutes to fully-provision your account.

After you log-in in your Oracle Cloud Account, you should see the web console, like this:

You will also need to install:

- To develop the integration with REST API we need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- To execute REST API calls, you can install [PostMan](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) (preferred for the graphic interface users) or [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html) if you want a console tool.

> NOTE:
>
> The installation of `Node.js` and `Postman` is explained later in the workshop but feel free to start installing if you want.

At this point, you are ready to start learning!
