I hope you could complete all the labs on this Oracle APEX and Digital Assistant labs and you learn the basic concepts from the technologies that we have use:
    - **Oracle Autonomous Database**
    - **Oracle Application Express**
    - **Oracle Digital Assistant**

The technologies that we have covered on this workshop are using **Always Free** and **Free Trial** credits so you don't have to pay for the services that you have use.

If you want to **Upgrade** the Instances that we used, you can follow these simple steps to upgrade to your favourite subscription model.
